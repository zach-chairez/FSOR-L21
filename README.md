  abstract = "As the digital world continues to grow in the age of big data,
              there beckons a need for efficient and robust methods for data
              exploration. Under the umbrella of machine learning, feature
              selection positions itself as a fruitful approach that uncovers
              buried truths and illuminates important features of data, all
              while minimizing long-term storage requirements. In this work, we
              introduce a set of novel single-view and multi-view supervised
              feature selection models which are embedded with orthogonality
              constraints to maintain data's structural integrity while
              confining the optimal solution's search space. Taking advantage
              of the underlying framework of these types of models, researchers
              have recently reformulated them as eigenvector and eigenvalue
              problems. Tapping into the extensively researched realm of
              numerical linear algebra, we solve these models with highly
              efficient and theoretically driven spectral theory based methods,
              and perform numerical experiments to compare our models with
              state-of-the-art feature selection techniques.",
